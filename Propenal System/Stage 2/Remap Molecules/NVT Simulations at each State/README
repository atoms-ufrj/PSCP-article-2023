As an example, we are showing the scripts used in the simulations of some sampled states.
The other sampled states can be analyzed similarly.

At each state, follow these steps:
1) run the script "in.step2.1" for system equilibration;
2) run the "in.step2.1" script to generate trajectory files every 200 fs;
3) run the "affine_transformation.py" script to perform affine transformations from the trajectory files obtained in the previous step.
